# Type Definitions

Type information can be utilized in Lua through the [Lua Language Server by sumneko](https://luals.github.io/)

[Download Client Type Definitions](pathname:///hubos-client.d.lua)

Place the type definitions file somewhere in your project folder and it will be automatically picked up by the language server.

If you haven't read the [Getting Started](/client/getting-started) guide already (which you should), this adds support for autocomplete / in editor documentation as well as light error detection that allows you to find errors before relaunching the client for faster iteration.
